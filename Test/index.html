      efficiency of the product design process. In the automotive industry, for
      instance, manufacturers used to create clay prototypes of new vehicle
      designs

    <h2>The Future of Virtual and Augmented Reality Technology</h2>
    <p>
     IT  is expected that businesses will continue to find new and exciting ways
      to use virtual and Augmented reality technology in the future. Some of the
      ways that these technologies could be used in the future include:

<p> <span>F</span> acebook has already announced plans to 
    utilize virtual and augmented reality
    technologies in an effort to transform the 
    remote workplace. Few details have been 
    released, but so far, the company has
    revealed that remote workers will be able to
     type on their physical keyboards while
     working on a virtual three-monitor computer. The B
    concept, which is still in the early stages of 
    development, would help overcome common
     remote work issues such as lack of space or equipment.
     As a result, this use of virtual and augmented reality technology could help more workers successfully shift
     to remote work.

<p> <span>T</span> here are a number of factors that are expected to drive this significant growth, including Better devices: Many consumers werenâ€™t initially interested in these 
    technologies because the headsets and glasses
    were bulky and uncomfortable. But now, the designs
     are becoming sleeker, lighter, and more comfortable to wear, which could attract a wider range of consumers. Substantial investments: Over $4 billion was invested in
     the virtual reality and augmented reality market in 
    2019 alone. These investments will most likely translate
     to massive growth in this industry over the next decade
